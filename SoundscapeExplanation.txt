This soundscape narrative includes the flow of my everyday life. It begins with an alarm clock going off, followed by a struggle to get out of bed at six in the morning. The alarm clock is the loud, annoying ring that a classic alarm clock gives. Waking up to this every morning sucks. Really lets you know the rest of the day will suck. This clip is extended due to getting out of bed being a struggle for a lot of college students. After getting up, is the gym, displayed within the narrative by the sounds of weights clanking and being dropped. Following the gym is a shower, before a class. After class, it is stated that I have no idea what is going on, displaying my everyday confusion with chemical engineering classes. After class is the sound of a PlayStation turning on. After my free, gaming time, I go to sleep. This whole day is repeated multiple times, but each time it is sped up. This repetitiveness with increasing speed displays the repetitiveness of life of not only me, but of a lot of college students. My goal was to relate to the listener. With this redundancy of life, I feel as if somebody listening could relate- therefore my goal would be achieved. The ending is important because it begins to repeat the entire process and fades out. It gives the listener a sense of every day will be exactly the same. If there is one thing I want the listener to take from this narrative is that every day will continue to be thee same, unless they do something about it.
